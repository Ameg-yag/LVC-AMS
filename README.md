# LVC-AMS
LV-Crew (LVC) Android Maintenance Scripts (AMS)


**THIS PROJECT IS "PRE-ALPHA" !!!**  
**THE SCRIPTS DON'T FULLY WORK BY NOW !!!**  
**THEY ARE ONLY INDENDED FOR DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO JOIN IN !!!**


**Let's call it "BleachBit for Android"! ;-)**  
(This project isn't officially connected with BleachBit!)  
(Get BleachBit: [https://www.bleachbit.org/](https://www.bleachbit.org/))


**"Till now there existed no cleaner that can clean up my whole phone!"  
(Tobias B. Besemer)

## Main benefits (Highlights)
The main benefits (Highlights) are:
- The only cleaner where you can follow what he is exactly doing (because it is a script)!
- No own code with bugs - just Linux standard commands!
- The only cleaner for cookies on Android and that for a lot of apps!
- Easy to participate (because it is a script)!
- Possibility to get the best cleaner for Android (because easy to participate)!
- Special script to restore privacy!


## tl;dr
Short explanaition on how to use it:
- Make sure you be "root", or "root" your device.
- Copy the folder LVC-AMS into the "root folder" of the "partition" you want to maintenance.
- If you want to maintenance e.g. "system" and "SDCard", you need one copy for each "partition".
- Install a (good) Terminal Emulator (e.g. Termux from: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)).
- Install maybe a keyboard that support "Ctrl + C" to abort the scrips at any point (e.g. Hacker's Keyboard from: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard)).
- Navigate into the LVC-AMS folder.
- Execute "LVC-AMS_-_Run_all.sh".
- If you have concerns about your privacy, you can instead execute "LVC-AMS_-_Run_privacy.sh" that deletes a bit more.
- That's it!

- Edit "LVC-AMS_-_Options_all.sh" and/or "LVC-AMS_-_Options_privacy.sh".
- Execute "LVC-AMS_-_Run_all.sh" to run all tasks.
- If you have concerns about your privacy, you can instead execute "LVC-AMS_-_Run_privacy.sh" that deletes a bit more.
- If you want to execute just one task, maybe edit the variables in the script, the run it.
- That's it!


## TO-DOS
TO-DOS-List:
- Add some echos
- And all the rest ^^
- GUI App to manage and execute the scripts


## Questions & Answers
**Why are the paths relative?**
- So you can also use the scrips e.g. on an external SD card that is ejected (and e.g. connected to your Linux Desktop).
- You can also "clean up" some old backup archives.
